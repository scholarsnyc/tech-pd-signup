# Professional Development Sign-up

A quick and dirty (emphasis on dirty) system to allow teachers to sign up for professional development sessions on April 19, 2013. This is based on an equally terrible parent-teacher conference sign-up form. Both projects probably need to be burned to the ground. Until then, I'm keeping the code online for the next time I need to ship something out the door at a rapid pace.

So it goes.
